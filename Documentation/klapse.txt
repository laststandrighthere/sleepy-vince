==================
Kernel-based Lapse
==================

Kernel-based Lapse (K-lapse) is a linear RGB scaling module that "shifts"
RGB based on time or brightness. This concept is inspired from LineageOS
(formerly known as CyanogenMod) ROM's feature "livedisplay" which also
changes the display settings (RGB, hue, temperature, etc) based on time.

Parameters
----------

Can be found /sys/module/klapse/parameters/

- enabled_mode
  Definition: Switch to enable or disable klapse.
  Values : 0 (off), 1 (time mode), 2 (brightness mode)

- start_minute
  Definition: Minute stamp at which klapse should start scaling the RGB
              values.
  Values : 0-1439 (Values from target to daytime)

- stop_minute
  Definition: The minute stamp by which klapse should scale back the RGB
              values.
  Values : 0-1439 (Values from target to daytime)

- daytime_r,g,b
  Definition: RGB used for all the time outside of start and stop minutes
              range, or above bl_range_upper.
  Values: 0-255,0-255,0-255

- target_r,g,b
  Definition: RGB values that will be scaled towards for all the time
              inside of start and stop minutes range, or below
              bl_range_lower.
  Values: 0-255,0-255,0-255

- target_minutes
  Definition: Minutes that RBG value will remain constant after reaching
              daytime.

- dimmer_factor
  Definition: Percentage of RBG values reduction.
  Values : 10-100

- dimmer_factor_auto
  Definition: Switch that allows you to automatically set the dimmer, only
              works if dimmer_factor is enabled.
  Value : 0,1

- dimmer_auto_start_minute
  Definition: Minute stamp at which dimmer_factor is applied.
  Values : 0-1439

- dimmer_auto_stop_minute
  Definition: Minute stamp at which brightness_factor will be reverted to
              100. Works only if dimmer_factor_auto is 1.
  Values : 0-1439

- bl_range_upper and _lower
  Definition: Brightness range within which klapse will scale from daytime
              to target_rgb. Works only enabled_mode is 2.
  Values : MIN_BRIGHTNESS-MAX_BRIGHTNESS

- pulse_freq
  Definition: Milliseconds after which klapse_pulse is called. Works only
              when enabled_mode and dimmer_factor_auto is 1.
  Values : 50-600000

- fadeback_minutes
  Definition: Minutes before klapse_stop_hour when RGB will start going back
              to daytime_rgb. Only works when enabled_mode is 1.
  Values : 0-{stop_minute - start_minute}

- flow_freq
  Definition: Milliseconds after which 1 RGB frame is shifted. Only works
              when mode 2 is enabled.
  Values : 50-600000
